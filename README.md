This app uses [Whisper](http://whisper.sh) API. It displays a scrolling list of whispers from the “Popular” feed. When a whisper is clicked, app shows a new list of whispers that represents the reply thread with the highest total heart count. Each whisper in the new list is a direct reply to the whisper before it. App shows the reply thread with a higher cumulative heart count.
